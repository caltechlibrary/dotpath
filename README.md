# dotpath

This is a collection of Go, Python and TypeScript modules implementing `getDotpath` and `hasDotpath` functions for working with maps, dictionaries and objects. It supports access and existance Go `map`, Python `dict` and TypeScript `object` or `{[key: string]: any}` using a dot path notation similar to that supported by [jq](https://jqlang.org).  

The Go package provides a simple mechanism to extract bits of JSON based on simple explicit dot path notation. This package is used by [dataset](https://github.com/caltechlibrary/dataset).
